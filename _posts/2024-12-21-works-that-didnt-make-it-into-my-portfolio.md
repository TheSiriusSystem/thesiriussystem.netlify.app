description: Not every project makes it to the spotlight, sometimes because they weren't portfolio-worthy. However, work is work and depending on its quality, it can augment one's portfolio. Here's a glimpse into mine.

In design, not everything can, or should, make it to the final cut. The following projects I'm about to show didn't quite align with my portfolio's vision; when curating my portfolio, I focus on showcasing work that may be professional and demonstrates technical proficiency. Still, they're part of my journey and deserve a little love. This post will delve into some of my past works and how they affected my graphic design journey.

### Business card for a client
This was my first attempt at making an original design. For security reasons, names and contact information are redacted.

In retrospect, the design bears a lot of similarities to this [design](https://www.alamy.com/modern-professional-business-card-design-image246664660.html){:target="_blank"}. It was not that original but it was a good start. This project sparked my passion for graphic design.

### Pride Baseball Bat Series
A collage of baseball bat product banners. I consider this the point where I started really getting into graphic design. Each banner is designed to be vibrant, bold, and unique. While they're not intended to be professional in any way, I have to give a honorable mention to them for kickstarting my creativity drive nonetheless!

### Desktop computer product banner
An old design I made for Nyta Narayanganj's graphic design classes. I think it holds up well enough to be included here, even if it's mostly a copy of this [design](https://www.freepik.com/premium-psd/business-promotional-social-media-print-ready-post-design-template_33917640.htm){:target="_blank"}.

### Pride Baseball Stadium Wallpaper
For this project, I thought about taking the theme that my Pride Baseball Bat series of product banners had established and went along with it to create a new design based on that concept.

Adobe Photoshop was used for making some color changes to the background. The rest? Made with Adobe Illustrator!

### Sirius Flag
A custom flag inspired by the star Sirius! Here's a fun fact, the colors of the main page were based on this flag.
